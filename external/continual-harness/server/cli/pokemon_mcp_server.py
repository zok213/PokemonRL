"""
Thin MCP proxy for the Pokemon Emerald game server.

Every @mcp.tool() function forwards its arguments as an HTTP request to the
corresponding /mcp/* endpoint on the game server (server/app.py).  No game
logic lives here — this module is purely a transport adapter between the
MCP protocol (used by Claude Code / Codex CLI / Gemini CLI) and the game server's
REST API.

TOOL RESTRICTION: For CLI agent experiments, only core game interaction tools
are exposed. CLI agents may implement their own abstractions for reflection,
memory, and planning systems. The objective system is not exposed as CLI agent
executions use milestones (not exposed to the agent) for progress 
tracking in .pokeagent_cache/{run_id}/cumulative_metrics.json. 

NOTE ON CONTAINERIZATION: It is  crucial that the game server in app.py is not 
exposed to CLI agents as that may enable inappropriate direct modification 
of the game state (i.e. manually loading of save states) or access to 
unwarranted context.

Available tools (2 total):
  Game: get_game_state, press_buttons
