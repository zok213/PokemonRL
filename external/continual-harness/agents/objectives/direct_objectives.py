Direct Objectives Module

Provides hardcoded, step-by-step objectives for specific game states to simplify
the agent's reasoning loop and ensure more reliable progression through key sequences.

This module contains predefined objective sequences for critical game phases
where the agent needs to follow a specific, well-defined path.
